# Multimodal-AD-Subtypes

By Yuval Kessel Meilichson

This Repository contains all of the Jupytor notebooks with data in my MSc Neuroscience thesis - 
Developing a unified representation of AD subtypes.

You will find 5 notebooks characterising the research phases:
1. Data processing.
2. Utilising SuStaIn to cluster the individual modalities and present subtypes.
3. Correlation of the subtypes into tripe clusters.
4. Characterisation of the clusters - clinical significance.
5. Testing - Multimodal and longitudinal.
